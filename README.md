Demo 2 : in which caffe pre - trained model is converted to Core Ml . It contains all the caffe model file and a code to convert it into core ML 
Caffe model is basically a Flower classifier


Demo 3 : We first get a data set (MNIST = a hand written digit dataset) and trained into keras and save that trained model into .h5 and then convert that model into CoreML


Demo 4 : A tensor model is converted into CoreML . All python code is available 


Demo 5 : Converted ski learn Linear model into coreML , trained that model into ski learn then converted it into CoreML
